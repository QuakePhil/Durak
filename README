One of my first pieces of code... The .BAS file is dated 2000-04-27

Last time I checked, the .EXE still worked, and I'm sure the .BAS does also (developed usingqbasic or qb45) but you should 
run the .EXE in a VM only as I have no clue what ancient viruses could be in there.  To be sure, it passed my anti-virus 
scan, but again I make no guarantees...

This is really here just for the sake of posterity
